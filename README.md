This project implements a hardware-optimized version of the Dual Combined Linear Congruential Generator (CLCG) for pseudo-random bit generation using Verilog HDL. The original design used a three-operand adder, while the modified version integrates a carry-save adder (CSA) to enhance speed and reduce critical path delay, making it more suitable for high-performance VLSI applications.
